Add new components in the `app/components` directory. Example:

   ```bash
   bin/rails generate component Navigation
   ```

2. Define the component's behavior in `app/components/navigation_component.rb` and its template in `app/components/navigation_component.html.erb` or directly in component definition with `erb_template`

3. Use the component in views:
   ```erb
   <%= render(NavigationComponent.new(title: "My Navigation")) %>
   ```
